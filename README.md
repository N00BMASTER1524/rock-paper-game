# rock-paper-game
my first ever js code 


Plan:
Remove the prompt logic: We no longer need the user to type input. Instead, the player will click buttons to choose rock, paper, or scissors.
Create Buttons for User Input: Add three buttons in the HTML (for rock, paper, and scissors).
Display the Score: Show the running score and announce the winner when someone reaches 5 points.
Replace console.log: Instead of logging to the console, we will update the DOM to show the results on the webpag
